      * √ the proto_extend member works with gettters and setters using option members as well
      * √ the proto_extend member works with gettters and setters as expected
      * √ the extend member works with gettters and setters as expected
    * Running subsequent unit tests with the build file brace_option_umd.js while loading the module from amdefine
      * √ returns the same data as passed in to the constructor if the the parameter was not a literal Object
      * √ returns an Object with the extended members
      * √ reverts properties which were originally added to the option
      * √ the clear member works with parameters as well

  * Using stop further progression methodology for file dependencies: zzz_run_me_last.js
    * Checking for dependencies..
      * √ requirejs in available to the module system
      * √ the build_umd program is available and at the right location
    * Running deployment build configuration
      * √ will build the project using the package script build command

  * 324 passing
